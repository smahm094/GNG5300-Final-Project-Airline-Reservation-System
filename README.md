# Final Project: Airline Reservation System

A mock-up of a web application for an Airline Reservation System was developed in this final project of the graduate-level course: GNG5300 - Full Stack Software Development.

* For webpage design: HTML/CSS/JavaScript  
* For data storage and connections: Python and MySQL

This project was developed and implemented on the Windows platform. 

Visual Studio Code was used as the development environment.

The web application features cater to three user types: 
*	Customers
*	Airline Staff 
*	Booking Agents

*	Each user, depending on user level is granted different permissions. 
*	All three user types are allowed to register for and log into their personal accounts and log back out when completed. All users that are not logged into the system are only allowed to perform three actions: view a current dashboard of flights, search for future flights, and register for new accounts. 
*	Customers are allowed to view their flights, search for flights, book tickets, submit ratings and comments for past flights, and track their spending given a specified time frame. 
*	Booking agents are able to view and search for specific flights on behalf of a customer and are able to place an order for them. Booking agents by default receive a commission from each customer transaction and are able to see their total commission and their top customers for a specific time frame. 
*	Airline staff have the most visibility in terms of overseeing processes - they can view and search for flights, change flight statuses and update a current list of airplanes, airports and cities. They are also able to view a summarized report of flight ratings, along with general statistics about frequent customers and top-performing booking agents. Additionally, they are allowed to view sales data given specific conditions and other reports. 

How to use the application: 
*	Python Flask must be set up and installed prior to running the application. 
*	When ready, the templated files (HTML/CSS/Javascript) may be imported into a code editor of your choice, along with app.py for use. 
*	Note that this application uses a MySQL database to store information, so a sample database must be set up for full functionality.
